                    My name is Andrew Owen, I am a 24 year old Compositor/Programmer who grew up in Vancouver, WA. I am currently living in Missoula, MT.
                    I graduated from the University of Montana, <i>cum laude</i>, with a Bachelors of Science, Computer Science. As well as a Minor in Media Arts.
                    I am currently working at <a href="https://fwp.mt.gov/">Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Division</a> as a software developer. 
                    Compositing wise, I last worked at <a href="https://www.warmsprings.tv/">Warm Springs Productions</a> on <a href="https://www.insp.com/shows/tall-tales-of-jim-bridger/">INSP's, <i>Tall Tales of Jim Bridger</i></a> as Lead VFX/GFX Artist. In addition to doing compositing work on 4 seasons of <a href="https://www.insp.com/shows/into-the-wild-frontier-insp-show/">INSP's, <i>Into the Wild Frontier</i></a>.
                    When I am not working as a software developer or compositing for media, I am working on various programming projects. 
                    Coding mainly in <strong>Python</strong>, I create various applications, tools, and scripts that can help me with my work.
                    Other projects I have worked on has included languages such as <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong> (this website being one of said projects).

                    After becoming partially deaf at the age of 11, visuals began to dominate my life. 
                    Growing up, most of my understanding of the world, its intricacies, its grotesqueness, its beauty, I understood through visuals.
                    While this has led to come challenges in life, I believe this also provided a unique opportunity to have a different perspective than normal.
                    Everyone has different ways of viewing the world.
                    I hope to bring new views, thoughts, and feelings to many others through the skills I have developing systems and creating visuals for many to admire.
