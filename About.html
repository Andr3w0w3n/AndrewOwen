                    My name is Andrew Owen, I am a 24 year old Compositor/Programmer who grew up in Vancouver, WA. I am currently living in Missoula, MT.
                    I graduated from the University of Montana, <i>cum laude</i>, with a Bachelors of Science, Computer Science. As well as a Minor in Media Arts.
                    Currently, I am working as Lead VFX/GFX Artist on an unnamed show, at <a href="https://www.warmsprings.tv/">Warm Springs Productions</a>. In addition to doing compositing work on 4 seasons of <a href="https://www.insp.com/shows/into-the-wild-frontier-insp-show/">INSP's, <i>Into the Wild Frontier</i></a>.
                    When I am not working artistically, I am working on various programming projects. 
                    Coding mainly in <strong>Python</strong> at the moment, I create various applications, tools, and scripts that can help me with my work.
                    Other projects I have worked on has included languages such as <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, and <strong>MySQL</strong>.

                    After becoming partially deaf at the age of 11, visuals began to dominate my life. 
                    Growing up, most of my understanding of the world, its intricacies, its grotesqueness, its beauty, I understood through visuals.
                    While this has led to come challenges in life, I believe this also provided a unique opportunity to have a different perspective than normal.
                    Everyone has different ways of viewing the world.
                    I hope to bring new views, thoughts, and feelings to many others through the skills I have developing systems and creating visuals for many to admire.
